					<h2>Chris Tyng</h2>
					<h4>Owner Star Hill Studio, Engineer, & Producer</h4>
					<p><img src="images/friends/chris_tyng.jpg" alt="Chris Tyng Photo" />We're really fortunate to have a pretty deep collection of great ribbons to choose from, from the more "modern" [Royer 122's & 122v's and AEA R88's] to true vintage [Coles 4038's, RCA's of all eras and flavors, Altec 639 Birdcages] to even some more offbeat additions [Shure 330's & 315's, Amperites] - and of course Cascade FAT HEAD'S!   You guys build some seriously awesome mics - we own FOUR Fat Head's already - and we now need to actually get TWO MORE Fat Head's for our drum booth, because all of the others already have fairly permanent roles that we love them for. Two of them are permanently parked in front of our selection of combo guitar amps in the live room, as they are just amazing at picking up the nuances of those different amps in the most clear, balanced and killer way! Even with all of the other choices at hand, the Fat Head's get a TON of use.</p>

I really love the sound of my banjo through this microphone!"</p>
